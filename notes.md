``` 
if condition:
    expression
else:
    expression
```

* The words **condition** and **Boolean** expression can often be used interchangeably.

* The function **len** can be used to find out the length of a string, among other things. The function returns the number of characters in a string.

* Python comparison operators can also be used on strings. String a is smaller than string b if it comes alphabetically before b. Notice however that the comparison is only reliable if:

	* the characters compared are of the same case, i.e. both UPPERCASE or both lowercase
	* only the standard English alphabet of a to z, or A to Z, is used.

#### Combining conditions

* The condition **x >= a and x <= b**, **x >= a or x <= b**, **not a**, **x >= a <= b**
*
