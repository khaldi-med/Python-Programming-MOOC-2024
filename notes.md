* print() => show the output

* print(f"") => to include varible in string using {}

* input() => aske the user for data

* str() => converted into a string

* int() => converted into a integer point number

* float() => converted into a floating point number

``` 
if condition:
    expression
else:
    expression
```

* The words **condition** and **Boolean** expression can often be used interchangeably.

* The function **len** can be used to find out the length of a string, among other things. The function returns the number of characters in a string.

* Python comparison operators can also be used on strings. String a is smaller than string b if it comes alphabetically before b. Notice however that the comparison is only reliable if:

	* the characters compared are of the same case, i.e. both UPPERCASE or both lowercase
	* only the standard English alphabet of a to z, or A to Z, is used.

#### Combining conditions

* The condition **x >= a and x <= b**, **x >= a or x <= b**, **not a**, **x >= a <= b**


#### Simple loops

* to use **sqrt** fun do this: **from math import sqrt**


#### Working with strings

* substrings and slices:

    * A substring of a string is a sequence of characters that forms a part of the string. 

    * In Python programming, the process of selecting substrings is usually called slicing, and a substring is often referred to as a slice of the string. The two terms can often be used interchangeably.

    * you can do so with the notation [a:b]. This means the slice begins at the index a and ends at the last character before index b - that is, including the first, but excluding the last.


* Searching for substrings:
    * The **in** operator can tell us if a string contains a particular substring. The Boolean expression a in b is true, if b contains the substring a.

*  Python string method **find**. It takes the substring searched for as an argument, and returns either the first index where it is found, or -1 if the substring is not found within the string.
